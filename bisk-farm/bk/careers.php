                              <p>We have consistently achieved phenomenal growth year after year. This rapid growth is due to us being ambitious, dedicated and largely Foodies at heart. These are the qualities that we share with our employees, who excel at the work place. This also explains why careers are also soaring at a phenomenal pace in our organisation. </p>

                              <p>While we are busy making the best products thus far, we are also tempted to reach out and encash the great opportunity that is present in the Processed Food Category. It is our ambition to spread out, across the country and become a dominant player in this industry. </p> 

                              <p> Whether your expertise is in Production (presently Manufacturing Facilities are based in W.Bengal and Maharashtra), Marketing, Sales or Logistics, as a young and vibrant Food Company, SAJ requires you. To sum it up, we have lots to do and we are reaching out to individuals who want to grow with us.</p>
